This is a play-scala app sample showing how to implement a simple blog site.
=================================

This file will be packaged with your application, when using `activator dist`.


Steps to Import into IntelliJ IDEA:
-----------------------------------
1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Import Project. Point it to where you cloned this repository
3. Make sure to set *SBT* as the external module builder for your project.
4. In terminal, make sure you type in *activator compile* to compile your resources first.
5. Now setup a SBT task in your IntelliJ.
6. Under task: fill in with "run".

Notes
-----
*In our build.sbt, we specifically add:
"dependencyOverrides += "org.scala-lang" % "scala-compiler" % scalaVersion.value"
to avoid any "conflicting cross-version in sbt" that results from scala-xml, and scala-parser-combination since
those are using scala 2.12.M06.
